You need to develop the grep utility:

Support of the following flags: -e, -i, -v, -c, -l, -n
cat .... Only pcre or regex libraries can be used for regular expressions
The source, header and make files must be placed in the src/grep/ directory
Cat ... The resulting executable file must be placed in the directory src/grep/ and named s21_grep
